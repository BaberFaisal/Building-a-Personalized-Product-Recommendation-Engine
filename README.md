### Building a Personalized Product Recommendation Engine

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the **Instacart Market Basket Dataset** to build a personalized product recommendation engine.  
Using historical transaction data, we aim to understand customer purchasing behavior and recommend products that customers are likely to reorder in future purchases.

## Dataset
The dataset is publicly available from [Instacart Market Basket Analysis on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis).  
It consists of over **3 million grocery orders** from **200,000 Instacart users**, including:

- `orders.csv` – order-level information (user, evaluation set, order number, days since prior order, etc.)
- `order_products__train.csv` – training set of user orders with the products purchased
- `order_products__prior.csv` – prior orders for users
- `products.csv` – product-level information (product name, aisle, department)
- `aisles.csv` – product aisle metadata
- `departments.csv` – department metadata

## Approach & Methodology
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
   - Import all datasets, check dimensions, and explore key attributes.  
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand user and product behavior.  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Generate user-level features (order frequency, reorder ratio, time patterns).  
   - Create product-level features (popularity, reorder probability).  
   - Build user-product interaction features (user’s history with a specific product).  

3. **Modeling & Recommendation**  
   - Use machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting) to predict the probability of a user reordering a product.  
   - Evaluate model performance with metrics such as **F1-score, precision, and recall**.  
   - Generate personalized recommendations for each user.  

4. **Results & Insights**  
   - Highlight the most predictive features for reorder likelihood.  
   - Provide examples of recommended products for users.  

## Installation & Requirements
To run the notebook, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
